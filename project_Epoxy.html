      <h1>Epoxy Research</h1>
      <p>
        This project focuses on predicting DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) properties based on the chemical composition of epoxy materials. The research was conducted in collaboration with KRICT (Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology) and Seoul National University's Department of Materials Science and Engineering.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a predictive pipeline using LightGBM for DMA property analysis.</li>
        <li>Utilized Isolation Forest to detect and remove outliers for cleaner datasets.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with KRICT and Seoul National University to ensure accurate preprocessing and data structuring.</li>
        <li>Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R2 metrics, achieving high accuracy in predictions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Research Process</h2>
      <p>The following steps were followed during the research:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Collected raw DMA data and conducted preprocessing based on experimental requirements.</li>
        <li>Performed feature engineering, including polynomial feature expansion for better model training.</li>
        <li>Trained machine learning models on preprocessed data, using LightGBM as the main algorithm.</li>
